This [Arduino clone](https://www.tindie.com/shops/Paulware/arduino-on-a-stick/) gives you all the functionality 
of an arduino in a significantly smaller form.

It has a built-in usb chip based on the cp2102.   The driver for this is located on the Silicon Labs [website](http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx)

To install the driver, unzip the CP210x_VCP_Windows.zip file and run the CP210xVCPInstaller_x64.exe from windows explorer.

The pinouts for this device are similiar to the Arduinos pinouts.  Here is a drawing to explain.
